# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Predicting heart disease using machine learning algorithms. In this project the dataset is taken with necessary filelds like cholestorel, blood pressure, age etc. of the person and analyzed the dataset using ML algorithms like SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Tuned RF and Neural Networks. The best model then tried to deploy using flask.
